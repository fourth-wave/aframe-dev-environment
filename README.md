An example a-frame project showing off simple animation, objects, color, shaows, and textures.

# Aframe
[Aframe](https://aframe.io) is a webVR framework originally conceived within Mozilla. It lets us quickly create Virtual Reality applications using only web technologies. With just HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript we can build complex VR websites that don't require a headset to use, but which support most headsets too. We have setup a simple webVR app that should instantly start when you start a droplet. In it, we have demonstrated creating simple objects, adding textures, shadows, backgrounds, planes, and some simple animation. Making changes and additions to the virtual environment is as simple as editing the index.html file and refreshing your web browser. The Entity-Component Architecture will be very familiar to anyone with HTML experience. Hopefully this will give you a great starting place for building webVR apps with Aframe.

# Using a One-Click at Digital Ocean
Find the project in `/home/aframe-dev-environment` and make changes to the index.html file under views. You can always run the node server yourself with `node server.js` from the main project directory. The node server should start when the droplet does. When it's on, you can make changes and immediately preview them and enter a VR enviroment by connecting to the IP address of your droplet with Firefox.
